#  Project Euler - Large Sum

So I have done another Project Euler assignment. This one is called large sum. You can find the assignment here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=13

The basic idea of this assignment is there is a gigantic number with tons of digits, and I have to take the sum of all the digits.

I did this by initializing the number as a string, so as to not have issues with the integer limit, and then iterated through the string, and added each value to the total.

In case you are wondering, the total is: 222660

The number is in the Project Euler link above. It would destroy this readme if I attached it. It's also available in the code file main.swift.

I will attach a binary in Releases. It will require a Mac to run. It should be optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel, so as long as your Mac is not very old, you should be able to run it. If it doesn't run, build it from source with Xcode.
